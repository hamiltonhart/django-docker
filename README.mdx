# Django-Docker Setup

This template was created mostly with the help of a tutorial found here:
https://londonappdeveloper.com/deploying-django-with-docker-compose/

A huge thank you to London App Developer for the tutorial.

## Basic Setup

- Copy code locally
- Build the image
  - docker-compose build
- Create a Django project (this template assumes the project is called app)
  - docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "django-admin startproject app ."
- Replace the settings.py and urls.py with those from the COPY-django_setup directory
  - This directory can be removed
- Spin up the container
  - docker-compose up
- Ensure the dev server is up and running
  - 127.0.0.1:8000/admin
